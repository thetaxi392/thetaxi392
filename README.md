- 👋 Hi, I’m @thetaxi392!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning all types of programming languages and web design techniques, but would like to start by becoming more than proficient in a couple. 
  My favorite language I'm learning about so far is JavaScript because I like making interactive websites. I also like working with Java Swing GUIs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, Java, and Adobe Creative Cloud. I will complete a CS in Web Development 
- at my local Community College in the fall of 2021.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any types of projects that can grow my skills and teach me new techniques. 
- 📫 Reach me by email at thetaxi392@gmail.com if you want to know more about me!
